To run this project, make sure you have the latest version of node.js and npm installed :

By adding the n module, you can interactively manage Node.js versions.

1. First, clear the npm cache:

```
$ npm cache clean -f
```

2. Install n, Nodeâ€™s version manager:

```
$ npm install -g n
```

3. With the n module installed, you can use it to:

- Install the latest stable version:

Note: Some Ubuntu distros may respond with the command not found output after running the n command. To fix this issue run sudo -E env "PATH=$PATH" [command]. For example, to install the latest stable version, as in the example above, you would run sudo -E env "PATH=$PATH" n stable.
